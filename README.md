# Simon-Says
I'm not going to lie. This code was incredibly difficult for me to do. It involved so much checking and so much code and experience with things I've only just learned. I felt like the jQuery section of this course wasn't dived into nearly enough to handle this particular project. It is not my favorite project that I've had to do, nor am I super proud of it. But, I wanted to post it here so that I can look back on it one day and revisit it to improve it and make it better. I want to add a way for it to increase the sequence as the level increases. I'm sure I would just need to add a for loop or something to do that, but I want to move on to other projects that are closer to what I want to create. So, for now, this is my Simon Says project from my Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp course.
